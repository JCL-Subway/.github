# Rochester Subway Archive

The Rochester Subway is a now-defunct underground rail system that operated in Rochester, New York from 1927 to 1956. The Rochester Subway Archive is a digital collection to preserve the history of the Rochester Subway from its inception to its modern day usage as a haven for graffiti artists.

The Archive includes a wide range of materials, including photographs, maps, videos, and articles.

Visitors to the site can explore the history of the Subway, learn about the different stations and routes, and see what the system looked like when it was in operation. The Archive also features personal stories and reminiscences from people who rode the Subway or worked on it, providing a unique window into what life was like in Rochester in the mid-20th century.

The Rochester Subway Archive is a valuable resource for anyone interested in the history of Rochester or the evolution of modern graffiti.

## __IMPORTANCE__

Much of the original Rochester Subway has been demolished or filled in with no trace that it was ever there to begin with. Not only was the subway a means of transportation, but in its later years it was also a gathering place for artists in the community. Through the walls of the abandoned subway art has emerged, fighting for social justice, togetherness, and has culminated into a unique ‘Rochester Style’ of Graffiti.

The Rochester Subway Archive team is a group of seniors from the Rochester Institute of Technology in the Humanities Computing and Design Major. Led by Dr. Jessica Leiberman who is an advisor to the city on the historical relevance of the subway, the team has worked to create an easy to navigate look into the rich history of The Rochester Subway.
